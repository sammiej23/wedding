    <h1>The details you need to know...</h1>
    <p>The wedding will take place at Middle Combe Farm, at Uplowman in Tiverton, Devon.
    You can find lots of information about the venue here: <a href="https://www.coombefarmwoods.co.uk/">Combe Farm Woods</a>.
    The venue is stunning - in the middle of the rolling Devonshire countryside. We also chose the venue because of its
    environmentally friendly and sustainable ethos: <a href="https://www.coombefarmwoods.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Eco-decv4-2.pdf">Eco Sustainable Declaration</a>.

    <h2>Travel options</h2>
    <p>We advise guests to use public transport to the venue where possible.</p>
    <p>Tiverton is easily accessible from London by train - the journey from Paddington takes between 2.5 and 3 hours.
        The farm is approximately 15 minutes by car from Tiverton Parkway train station.
    </p>
    <p>If you are travelling by car, please be advised there is approximately 0.5 miles of tight single track
    road leading to the farm. You will be required to park your vehicles in the field at the top of the entrance
    to the farm which will be sign posted to the left, and walk into the farm itself. </p>

    <h2>Itinerary</h2>
    <p>Everything is happening at the one venue - Middle Combe Farm. The legal ceremony will take place in the
    Cider Barn at 12.30pm. I want to tell you what else we have planned but Dan won't let me - he wants it to be a surprise :D </p>

    <h2>Practical advice type things...</h2>
    <p>Ladies - some of the wedding celebrations will take place outside so there will be some walking on grass.
    You might want to opt for flat shoes or bring a pair with you for this reason.</p>
    <p>Cash bar? TBC</p>
    <p>Please do not bring paper confetti, it's not allowed at the venue. Bubbles or bio-degradable confetti?</p>
