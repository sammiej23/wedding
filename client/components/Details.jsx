    to the farm which will be sign posted to the left, and walk into the farm itself. </p>

    <h2>Itinerary</h2>
    <p>Everything is happening at the one venue - Middle Combe Farm. The legal ceremony will take place in the
    Cider Barn at 12.30pm. I want to tell you what else we have planned but Dan won't let me - he wants it to be a surprise :D </p>

    <h2>Practical advice type things...</h2>
    <p>Ladies - some of the wedding celebrations will take place outside so there will be some walking on grass.
    You might want to opt for flat shoes or bring a pair with you for this reason.</p>
    <p>Cash bar is to TBC</p>
    <p>Please do not bring paper confetti, it's not allowed at the venue. Petal confetti or bubbles if you feel you need to throw something at us ;) </p>
