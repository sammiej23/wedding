      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>We met on April 12th 2014, on a pretty grey day and the South Bank.
      Sam was 10 minutes late as usual, and Dan had got us tickets for the matinee
      of <a href="https://amazingbubbleman.com/">The Bubble Man</a>.
      After a few drinks and a wander along the river towards The Tate Modern, we started to realise we quite liked
      each other &hearts;</p>
      <p>Dan moved to Camden to live with Sam in January 2015 as a temporary measure until we found a
      bigger place. He's still here ;)
      </p>
      <p>Since we met, we've spent a season snowboarding in Morzine, a couple of holidays in cottages in Cornwall and
      Yorkshire and a few short lived attempts at having a jam which didn't work due to musical differences. </p>
      <p>In August 2016 on holiday in Cheddar, Somerset, in a static caravan, Dan proposed with the most
      awesome ring from <a href="https://www.thegreatfroglondon.com/">The Great Frog</a>. Sam said yes.</p>
